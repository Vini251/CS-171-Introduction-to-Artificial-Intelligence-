# CS-171-Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence

**Summary:**

This project was about making a Checkers game played by AI. There were 3 different agents playing Draft_AI, Average_AI and Random_AI that would play againt each other. We had to measure the efficiency of the agent by comparing the wins and losses. 

This was a pair project.
